# Rendering Engine

This is a Rendering Engine developed using SDL only, the idea it's to have a minimal base to iterate from for future development. For now It has an OpenGL like library and a math library for matrix and vector operations.

This renderer was made based on Sloy's tutorials for renderering TinyRenderer if you wanna learn in deep how this works please check the tutorial by him.
